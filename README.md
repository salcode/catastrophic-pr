# Catastrophic Pull Request

This repo goes with the blog post [Always Bring Your Pull Requests Up to Date](https://salferrarello.com/always-bring-your-pull-requests-up-to-date)

While the `main` branch runs properly, and [PR #1](https://github.com/salcode/catastrophic-pr/pull/1) runs properly, if you merge the PR, it will fail catastrophically.
